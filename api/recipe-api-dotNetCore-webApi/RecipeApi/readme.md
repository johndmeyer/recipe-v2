To build a docker image and deploy to Azure complete the following steps.

Prereqs:
* Ensure that docker (docker desktop) is installed on your local system
* Ensure that the Azure CLI is installed on your system

* Basic Approach:
  * Locally build the image, run this in a container and test that things are working as expected.
  * Create an Azure resource group within the Azure UI
  * Create an Azure container registry within the Azure CLI
  * Login to Azure via the CLI `az login` this should open a browser window that allows you to 
authenticate. There is likely a better way to do this via automation. 
  * Build, tag, and push the image to the container registry `az acr build --image <image-name> --registry <container-registry-name> --file <file-path/file-name> .`.
  * Within the Azure UI create an 'App Service/Web App' - give it a name, publish using 'container' 
on linux. For the image source choose Azure Container Registry and select the image that was just pushed. 
Create the app - this will take a few minutes. When complete the API should be accessible via the 'default domain' link.

Build image:
* Background: The Dockerfile is located in the Api project within the solution. This dockerfile 
was generated by the IDE and could likely be optimized. The Dockerfile was created in the API 
project as this is an N-Tier application and the API project is the top level project - the other
projects compile to class libraries that are used by the API project.
