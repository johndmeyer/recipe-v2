# recipe-v2

This repo is a full stack application developed in various popular languages and frameworks designed to showcase my software development skills. Essentially a cook book, this application allows the end user to input and store recipes, edit the ingredients and equipment needed for each recipe, and to tag the recipes with identifiers that allow a quick search.  

This repo is a work in progress. Eventually I would like to have this application completed using the following languages / frameworks / technologies, and create a 'switchboard' that can be used to mix and match the different layer for benchmarking:

  * Back End / Database:
    * SQL / MySQL
    * TSQL / MS SQL Server
    * PL/pgSQL /  PostgreSQL
    * MongoDb
  * Middle Tier / API
    * Express.js
    * Python / Flask
    * .Net Core / WebApi
  * Front End / UI
    * Vue.js
    * React.js
    * Angular.js
  * Supporting Technologies
    * Containerization via Docker / Kubernetes
    * Hosting via AWS
    * Hosting via Azure
    * Authorization using JWT tokens
    * Logging to an ELK stack
    * A DevOps platform for CI/CD build, test, and deploy
