# recipe-v2

This repo is a full stack application developed in various popular languages and frameworks designed to showcase my software development skills. An application that allow the end user to input and store recipes, edit the ingredients and equipment needed and to tag the recipes with identifiers that allow a quick search. My former employers would not allow me to copy the repos I worked on as an employee, so I'm recreating some of the functionality any application might need. 

This repo is a work in progress. Eventually I would like to have this application completed using the following languages / frameworks / technologies, and create a 'switchboard' that can be used to mix and match the different layer for benchmarking:

  * Back End / Database:
    * SQL / MySQL
    * TSQL / MS SQL Server
    * PL/pgSQL /  PostgreSQL
  * Middle Tier / API
    * Express.js
    * Python / Flask
    * .Net Core / WebApi
  * Front End / UI
    * Vue.js
    * React.js
    * Angular.js
  * Supporting Technologies
    * Containerization via Docker / Kubernetes
    * Hosting via AWS
    * Hosting via Azure
