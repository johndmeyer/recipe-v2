## Key Features

Among the many features which the Kendo UI for Angular Date Inputs deliver are:

* [Forms Support](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/forms)&mdash;The package provides support for both asynchronous template-driven Angular forms and predominantly synchronous reactive Angular forms. This feature allows you to make use of the logic set either in the template or in the component's TypeScript code.
* [Date and Time Ranges](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/date-ranges)&mdash;Except for the MultiViewCalendar, all Date Inputs provide configuration options for setting a start and end date or time and, in this way, defining date or time ranges.
* [Disabled Date Inputs](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/disabled-state)&mdash;You can choose to render the Date Inputs in their disabled state so that they are read-only.
* [Selection Modes](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/calendar/selection-modes)&mdash;The Date Inputs provide a number of selection modes which allow users to select a single date, a range of dates, or multiple dates.
* [Formats](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/formats)&mdash;The components in the Date Inputs package provide the ability to configure a desired date format for the displayed value.
* [Placeholders](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/placeholders)&mdash;The Date Inputs conveniently enable you to render a text hint inside the their input field to give the users an indication of what type of value they should provide and in what format.
* [Typing](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/typing)&mdash;You can control the user typing experience of the input-based Date Inputs by configuring the available typing options depending on your specific requirements.

* [Integration with JSON](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/integration-with-json)&mdash;Since the Date Inputs only work with JavaScript Date instances, and the data received from the server is serialized in JSON format, the components provide options for binding to dates that are serialized as strings.
